{"title": "Lancaster A at SemEval-2017 Task 5: Evaluation metrics matter: predicting sentiment from financial news headlines", "abstract": "This paper describes our participation in Task 5 track 2 of SemEval 2017 to predict the sentiment of financial news headlines for a specific company on a continuous scale between -1 and 1. We tackled the problem using a number of approaches, utilising a Support Vector Regression (SVR) and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM). We found an improvement of 4-6% using the LSTM model over the SVR and came fourth in the track. We report a number of different evaluations using a finance specific word embedding model and reflect on the effects of using different evaluation metrics.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction The objective of Task 5 Track 2 of SemEval (2017) was to predict the sentiment of news headlines with respect to companies mentioned within the headlines."}, {"id": 1, "string": "This task can be seen as a financespecific aspect-based sentiment task (Nasukawa and Yi, 2003) ."}, {"id": 2, "string": "The main motivations of this task is to find specific features and learning algorithms that will perform better for this domain as aspect based sentiment analysis tasks have been conducted before at SemEval (Pontiki et al., 2014) ."}, {"id": 3, "string": "Domain specific terminology is expected to play a key part in this task, as reporters, investors and analysts in the financial domain will use a specific set of terminology when discussing financial performance."}, {"id": 4, "string": "Potentially, this may also vary across different financial domains and industry sectors."}, {"id": 5, "string": "Therefore, we took an exploratory approach and investigated how various features and learning algorithms perform differently, specifically SVR and BLSTMs."}, {"id": 6, "string": "We found that BLSTMs outperform an SVR without having any knowledge of the company that the sentiment is with respect to."}, {"id": 7, "string": "For replicability purposes, with this paper we are releasing our source code 1 and the finance specific BLSTM word embedding model 2 ."}, {"id": 8, "string":
