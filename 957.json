"Building such resources is however exceedingly expensive, requiring highly skilled annotators or professional translators (Preiss, 2012) ."}, {"id": 2, "string": "Comparable corpora, that are sets of texts in two or more languages without being translations of each other, are often considered as a solution for the lack of parallel corpora, and many techniques have been proposed to extract parallel sentences (Munteanu et al., 2004; Abdul-Rauf and Schwenk, 2009; Smith et al., 2010) , or mine word translations (Fung, 1995; Rapp, 1999; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002; Morin et al., 2007; Vuli\u0107 and

propose is based on (Enright and Kondrak, 2007) 's approach to parallel document identification."}, {"id": 8, "string": "Documents are treated as bags of words, in which only blank separated strings that are at least four characters long and that appear only once in the document (hapax words) are indexed."}, {"id": 9, "string": "Given a document in language A, the document in language B that share the largest number of these words is considered as parallel."}, {"id": 10, "string": "Although very simple, this approach was shown to perform very well in detecting parallel documents in Wikipedia (Patry and Langlais, 2011) ."}, {"id": 11, "string": "The reason for this is that most hapax words are in practice proper nouns or numerical entities, which are often cognates."}, {"id": 12,
