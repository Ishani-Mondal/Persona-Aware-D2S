{"title": "Incremental Syntactic Language Models for Phrase-based Translation", "abstract": "This paper describes a novel technique for incorporating syntactic knowledge into phrasebased machine translation through incremental syntactic parsing. Bottom-up and topdown parsers typically require a completed string as input. This requirement makes it difficult to incorporate them into phrase-based translation, which generates partial hypothesized translations from left-to-right. Incremental syntactic language models score sentences in a similar left-to-right fashion, and are therefore a good mechanism for incorporating syntax into phrase-based translation. We give a formal definition of one such lineartime syntactic language model, detail its relation to phrase-based decoding, and integrate the model with the Moses phrase-based translation system. We present empirical results on a constrained Urdu-English translation task that demonstrate a significant BLEU score improvement and a large decrease in perplexity.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction Early work in statistical machine translation viewed translation as a noisy channel process comprised of a translation model, which functioned to posit adequate translations of source language words, and a target language model, which guided the fluency of generated target language strings (Brown et al., This research was supported by NSF CAREER/PECASE award 0447685, NSF grant IIS-0713448, and the European Commission through the EuroMatrixPlus project."}, {"id": 1, "string": "Opinions, interpretations, conclusions, and recommendations are those of the authors and are not necessarily endorsed by the sponsors or the United States Air Force."}, {"id": 2, "string": "Cleared for public release (Case Number 88ABW-2010-6489) on 10 Dec 2010."}, {"id": 3, "string": "1990)."}, {"id": 4, "string": "Drawing on earlier successes in speech recognition, research in statistical machine translation has effectively used n-gram word sequence models as language models."}, {"id": 5, "string": "Modern phrase-based translation using large scale n-gram language models generally performs well in terms of lexical choice, but still often produces ungrammatical output."}, {"id": 6, "string": "Syntactic parsing may help produce more grammatical output by better modeling structural relationships and long-distance dependencies."}, {"id": 7, "string": "Bottom-up and top-down parsers typically require a completed string as input;
